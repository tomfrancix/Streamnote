# The Task Manager

Tasks are divided into the 'to do' list, your tasks, and completed tasks.

In the 'to do' list, all users in the group can see all tasks that are not yet started.

In 'your tasks' only the tasks that _you_ are working on will be visible.

# The Content Stream

Posts can be created using the zero-distraction block editor which allows you to add content to a post block-by-block.

Blocks can be videos, images, or text. If the users chooses to add a text block, a text editor allows them to format the text to their choosing.

Once posts are published the user has an admin area to view/edit their posts, and they can change the publicity settings.

In this view users can filter content using a range of filters.
